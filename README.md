# CMSC320 Final Project: Adopt Animal Trends in Texas
Author: Long Wang, Tian Li, and Wensen Lin

<b>Introduction:</b>

Animal welfare is an important issue that affects millions of animals across the United States. One key aspect of animal welfare is animal adoption, which helps to provide loving homes for animals in need and reduces the number of animals in shelters. In Texas, animal adoption is an important issue that has garnered significant attention in recent years. Understanding animal adoption trends in Texas can provide valuable insights into how to improve animal welfare in the state.

This data science project aims to analyze animal adoption trends in Austin, Texas using data from data.austintexas.gov. By examining factors such as the type of animal, location, and adoption process, we aim to identify any patterns or trends in adoption rates over time. Our research question is:

What are the animal adoption trends in Texas, and how do they vary based on factors such as the type of animal, location, and adoption process?

Our analysis will contribute to the existing literature on animal welfare in Texas by providing insights into the factors that affect animal adoption rates in the state. We hope our findings will be helpful to animal shelters, rescue organizations, and policymakers working to improve animal welfare in Texas and across the country.
